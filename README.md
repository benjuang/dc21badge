On the floor is a cypher for the 1930's novelette "Chain of Death".
It reads "KEYWORDHMODOXIAN".  Maybe an O is missing. Maybe we screwed it up.

https://www.defcon.org/1o57/dc21/homodoxian/ is a clue.

Another floor puzzle, the sun clock, can be decoded with rod numerals.
https://www.defcon.org/1o57/dc21/orrery/ is a clue.

The cyrptogram on the top left of the sign outside the 1057 room reads:
    HAVE FUN
    NEED HELP
    JUST ASK
    PASSCODE
    SYZYGY

https://www.defcon.org/1o57/dc21/syzygy/ is a clue.

The symbols are also from "Chain of Death".

Queen cards might include Trinity, Acid burn, and Mouse.

Badges have playing card designs varrying by suit and number.  On the
back of each card is a string of numbers.  These appear to be 2-digit
numbers ranging from 01-26 which are ordinals into a mapping of
the alphabet.  The mapping is either the standard A-Z mapping or ROT-13,
seemingly indicated by the suit.  At least some of the sentence
fragements are from Rush's Tom Sawyer.

Badges also have a 3-digit binary number on the back.  Some badges also
depict a simple number generator that produces the following sequences.

      +-------+
      v       |

    110 (6)   |
    111 (7)   |
    011 (3) --+

e, pi and a circular icon also appear on different suits instead of the circuit.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity could connect them.
