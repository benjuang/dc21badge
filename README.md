DEFCON 21 badge hacking.  Work in progress.

Details
=======
Badges have playing card designs with at least red and black variations per
number.  On the back of each card is a string of numbers.  These appear to
be 2-digit numbers ranging from 01-26 which are ordinals into a mapping of
the alphabet.  Red cards map to the standard A-Z mapping and Black cards
map to Rot13.
