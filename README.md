DEFCON 21 badge hacking.  Work in progress.

Details
=======
Badges have playing card designs with at least red and black variations per
number.  On the back of each card is a string of numbers.  These appear to
be 2-digit numbers ranging from 01-26 which are ordinals into a mapping of
the alphabet.  Red cards map to the standard A-Z mapping and Black cards
map to Rot13.

Badges also have a 3-digit binary number on the back.  Some badges also
depict a simple number generator that produces the following sequence.

    001 (1) <-+
    100 (4)   |
    010 (2)   |
    101 (5)   |
    110 (6)   |
    111 (7)   |
    011 (3) --+
